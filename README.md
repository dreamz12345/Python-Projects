# Python Projects

Author of this repository: Lukasz Spychala

This repository contains all of my code that I created while  
learning to code in Python. I decided to use GitHub to learn  
version control software and build my portfolio.  
Most of it is coding exercises from a python programming course by  
Dr. Angela Yu - 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023
