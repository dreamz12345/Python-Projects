# Pong - Famous Arcade Game

Here's my take on the famous arcade game - Pong. Game supports
many interesting features that I lised below.

## 1. Screen
- Background color - Black
- Ball, Tennis Rocket, Scoreboard color - White
- White vertical dotted line in the middle of the screen 
    separating left and right side

## 2. Scoreboard
- Keeping track of players score (left for player, right for computer)
- Give point to the other side of the table when ball touches left or 
    right side of the screen

## 3. Tennis Rocket
- Allowed vertical movement within screen only

## 4. Ball
- Bounce of tennis rockets
- Bounce of top and bottom of the screen
- On touch Left/Right side of the screen reset the ball to the middle
    and give it random direction
- With each bounce the speed of the ball increases for engaging gameplay.

## 5. Physics
- When the ball bounces of tennis rocket it will change its direction
    based on wheter the rocket was movin up/down/not moving.
